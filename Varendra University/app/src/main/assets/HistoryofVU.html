    <div><strong>HISTORY OF VU</strong></div>
</div>
<div class="page-details">
    <p>At the initiative of Mr. Hafizur Rahaman Khan, the Honorable Chairman of VUT, a meeting attended by some distinguished educationists and social workers was convened at the Varendra University (proposed) campus in Rajshahi city. In the meeting, Mr. Khan, in his speech, explained the enormous problems prevailing in the sector of higher education of the country, particularly in the northern region. The number of students seeking admission for higher education has increased in an amazing rate but the number of universities has not increased proportionately. Naturally, too many students cannot enroll in their undergraduate programs. Many students have to enroll into the colleges under National University which unfortunately cannot impart quality education to constraints of all kinds. Mr. Khan also stressed the deteriorating conditions of higher education which he attributed to mounting physical violence and party politics in an epidemic scale among the students on the one hand and the involvement of the teachers in extra-academic affairs on the other. He, therefore, justified the need for a private University in the Rajshahi region to provide quality higher education to the ever-increasing number of students and proposed its establishment. He further explained that the campus of the University should be away from the &lsquo;madding crowd&rsquo; and it should be calm, quiet and tranquil so that academic activities can be pursued in an atmosphere free from the noise and bustle of a big city. All who were present in the meeting accepted his proposal in one voice and urged him to propagate higher education in this less developed part of the country.</p>

    <h4>VISION AND MISSION</h4>
    <p>The vision of Varendra University is to be established as a top-ranking university nationally and internationally through continuous innovation in education, research, creativity, and entrepreneurship.</p>
    <p>The mission of VU is to prepare students as competent, compassionate, ethically driven, and socially responsive professionals; to educate them through research for intellectual as well as social transformation and to enhance their lifelong learning capacity for adaptability to face the challenges of the 21st century.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h4>AIMS AND OBJECTIVES OF THE UNIVERSITY</h4>
    <p>VU, in general, aims at preparing its students nurturing their potentialities and proficiencies relating to the development of leadership, entrepreneurship and professionalism. It facilitates students&rsquo; involvement in higher research and implementation of the technological knowhow and ideas. The University is committed to work for the sustainable development and changes for the betterment of the society through a fruitful interaction with the government, business and social welfare organizations and with any international organizations as well. In this world of information, VU endeavors to accelerate students&rsquo; technological, intellectual, social and personal potentials providing them dynamic guidance&nbsp;&nbsp; and latest information about the new technologies of the world so that they can keep pace with the time and contribute to the advancement of the society. In an economically emerging country like Bangladesh, investment in higher education can lead to social returns of 10% by some estimate, which in turn means that these investments lead to increase in labor productivity, and short and long term growth at the same time.</p>
    <p>The demand for higher education in Bangladesh is very rapidly increasing. In the public Universities more than 20 students vie for a seat on an average. Moreover, they have to work in an atmosphere where party politics is strongly present, and financial constraint is another hard reality. Students, there, spend much of their energy in political activities rather than devoting themselves in study.&nbsp; The disruption in the schedule of classes during the academic year has given rise to new terms such as &lsquo;Session Jam&rsquo; and &lsquo;Session lag&rsquo;. Students who are entering into a four year honors degree program in a public University have to spare five to six years at least.</p>
    <p>Rajshahi is called the &lsquo;city of education&rsquo;. Students of the entire northern region of the country come here for higher education targeting Rajshahi University, Rajshahi University of Engineering and Technology, and Rajshahi Medical College. More than one lakh students apply for admission in Rajshahi University but only five thousand or so get admitted. The rest can hardly enter any other public University. Private Universities are badly needed in the city to cater for the demands in higher education of this domain. Naturally, keeping this inevitability in mind, the sponsors consider the initiative with prime importanceto open a University named Varendra University in Rajshahi in 2012. Since then VU has endeavored itself in providing quality education in this region.</p>
    <p>The higher demand for tertiary education has led to the emergence and quick development of Private Universities.&nbsp; Most private universities have few departments/ subjects having very high demand in the job market. They ignore the basic spirit of the university itself. A university must teach a wide variety of subjects and cultivate knowledge of as many kinds as possible. Moreover, many of them charge high tuition and other fees but provide inadequate financial support and scholarship for the poor and meritorious students. Varendra University, though very new, is dispensing quality education to the students at a comparatively affordable cost. In addition, it offers adequate scholarships and financial help to the students.</p>
    <p>However, private Universities are contributing significantly to the human resource development of the country. As the government alone cannot satisfy the demand of higher education, a public&ndash;private partnership can help the country meet the growing demand of higher education in Bangladesh, and Varendra University has been working keeping this spirit in view.<br />&nbsp;</p>
